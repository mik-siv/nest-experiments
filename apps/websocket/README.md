## Client

The client is a single-page Vue.js application. It utilizes WebSocket to communicate with the server in real time.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project:

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate inside the project directory and install the dependencies:
3. Start the server:
4. In another terminal window, start the client:
After these steps, your application should be running at [http://localhost:5174](http://localhost:5174).
